# Sequence Alignment

Sequence alignment is a fundamental concept in computational genomics that involves arranging DNA, RNA, or protein sequences to identify regions of similarity. These similarities may be a consequence of functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences.

## Importance in Computational Genomics

Sequence alignment plays a crucial role in:

- **Evolutionary studies**: Identifying homologous regions between species
- **Functional analysis**: Finding conserved domains that may indicate functional importance
- **Structural prediction**: Inferring structural similarities based on sequence conservation
- **Variant detection**: Identifying mutations, insertions, and deletions
- **Assembly**: Reconstructing genomes from short sequence reads
