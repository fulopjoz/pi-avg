# Code Examples for Computational Genomics

This section provides practical implementations of key algorithms and techniques in computational genomics. The examples are primarily in Python, with some implementations in other languages where appropriate.

## Topics to be Covered

- **Sequence Alignment Implementations**:
  - Basic pairwise alignment (global, local, semi-global)
  - Affine gap penalties
  - Multiple sequence alignment

- **String Matching Algorithms**:
  - Exact pattern matching (naive, KMP, Boyer-Moore)
  - Approximate pattern matching

- **Data Structure Implementations**:
  - Suffix trees and arrays
  - Burrows-Wheeler Transform and FM-Index
  - De Bruijn graphs

- **Genome Assembly**:
  - Read overlap detection
  - De Bruijn graph construction and traversal
  - Contig generation

- **Variant Calling**:
  - SNP detection
  - Structural variant identification

- **Phylogenetic Analysis**:
  - Distance-based methods
  - Maximum likelihood methods
