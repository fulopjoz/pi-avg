# Data Structures for Computational Genomics

This section covers specialized data structures used in computational genomics for efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of genomic data.

## Topics to be Covered

- **Suffix Trees**: Efficient data structure for string operations with applications in pattern matching
- **Suffix Arrays**: Space-efficient alternative to suffix trees
- **Burrows-Wheeler Transform**: Data structure for efficient string compression and search
- **FM-Index**: Full-text index based on BWT for efficient pattern matching
- **De Bruijn Graphs**: Graph structure used in genome assembly
- **Bloom Filters**: Probabilistic data structure for membership queries in large datasets
- **Sparse Arrays**: Efficient representation of genomic variation data
- **Interval Trees**: Data structure for efficient interval queries in genomic regions
